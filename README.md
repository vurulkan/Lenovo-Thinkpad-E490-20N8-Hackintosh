## ✅ What Works

- Intel UHD 620 Graphics (full acceleration)
- Audio (internal speakers, microphone, headphone jack)
- Brightness control (Fn keys)
- Wi-Fi (AirportItlwm)
- Bluetooth (IntelBluetoothFirmware + BlueToolFixup)
- Keyboard (including Fn keys)
- TrackPad & TrackPoint
- Sleep/Wake
- Battery status
- USB ports (mapped)
- Ethernet (RealtekRTL8111)
- Integrated Camera
- CPU power management (with CPUFriend profiles)

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- None — everything works as expected  
  *(Balanced+Quiet CPUFriend profile slightly reduces performance for quieter operation.)*

  *(AMD Radeon RX 550X disabled for compability reasons.)*

## 📄 SSDTs

All SSDTs were custom-extracted and compiled for this device:

- **SSDT-EC.aml** – Adds Embedded Controller  
- **SSDT-RTCAWAC.aml** – Fix system clock/timers (RTC/AWAC patch)  
- **SSDT-USBX.aml** – USB power properties  
- **SSDT-PLUG.aml** – CPU power management  
- **SSDT-PNLF.aml** – Backlight control

## ⚙️ CPUFriendDataProvider Profiles

Two variants are included in `/OC/Kexts`:

1. **`CPUFriendDataProvider.kext.stock`** – Stock macOS power management  
2. **`CPUFriendDataProvider.kext.balanced`** – Slightly reduced turbo boost for quieter fan and lower temps  

**Switching:**
- In `/OC/Kexts`, **rename** the desired profile by removing `.stock` or `.balanced` from the end, so it becomes `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext`
- Delete the other unused profile

## 🚀 Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repo OR download latest release from releases
2. Copy EFI to your USB’s EFI partition
3. Use GenSMBIOS:
```bash
1 (Select config.plist)
3 (Type: MacBookPro15,4)
```
4. Replace SMBIOS info in config.plist with generated values
5. Boot from USB and test before installing to internal disk

## 📝 Notes

    Tested with macOS Monterey 12.x

    Built with OpenCore 1.0.4

    All SSDTs extracted & patched manually

    Wi-Fi & Bluetooth use Intel kexts — already included

    Balanced+Quiet profile recommended for daily use
